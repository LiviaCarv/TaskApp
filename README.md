# Task App

TaskApp is a task management application designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks and supports task transition between three states: To-do, Doing, and Done.

## Functionality
- Task List: RecyclerView is used to display the user's task list, which is divided into three tabs (To-do, Doing, Done) based on the task status.
- Task State Transition: Users can move tasks between To-do, Doing, and Done states using the arrows.
- User Authentication: Utilizes Google Firebase for user authentication, including account creation, login, and account recovery.
- Real-time Database: Stores user's tasks using Google Firebase Realtime Database service.
- Task Manipulation: Users can edit and delete tasks as needed.

## Technologies Used:

- RecyclerView: Display tasks in a scrollable list.
- Fragments: Organize UI components into reusable components.
- TabLayout: Implement tabs for easy navigation between task states.
- Safe Args: Navigate and pass data between destinations using type-safe arguments.
- Navigation Component: Implement navigation between fragments and manage back stack behavior.
